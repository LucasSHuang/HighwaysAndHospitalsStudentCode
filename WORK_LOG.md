| Sep 12 | 2-2:35pm |                                                                                                                                         I thought a lot about how to solve this, and came up with an idea of using an arraylist of all of the city connections and then trying to find the one with the most connections |
| Sep 15 | 2:30-3pm |                                                                                                                                        I tried to implement this and also add more so that after I add a hospital in that spot I need to find a way to check if there isn't a way for a city to connect to that hospital |
| Sep 15 |  9-10pm  |  I initially continued my work but I feel like it wasn't working and didn't make that much sense. I started to change my method to one of building a hospital in the first city and then building a hospital in a city that has no way to connect to it. Still, this feels like something that would be very hard to do. |
