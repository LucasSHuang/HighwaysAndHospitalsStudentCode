| Sep 12 |  2-2:35pm   |                                                 I thought a lot about how to solve this, and came up with an idea of using an arraylist of all of the city connections and then trying to find the one with the most connections. I don't know exactly if this will work but I'm going to just feel things out for now. |
| Sep 15 |  2:30-3pm   |          I tried to implement this and also add more so that after I add a hospital in that spot I need to find a way to check if there isn't a way for a city to connect to that hospital. I feel like this is kind of an awkward way of doing the problem set and probably wrong but I'm going to continue trying it. |
| Sep 15 |   9-10pm    | I initially continued my work but I feel like it wasn't working and didn't make that much sense. I started to change my method to one of building a hospital in the first city and then building a hospital in a city that has no way to connect to it. Still, this feels like something that would be very hard to do. |
| Sep 16 |  6:30-7pm   |            Right now I'm working on implementing the union sort. I'm going down the process of making an array to keep track of the root for each one and then after that doing some checks but I feel like it is not working correctly. I need to change the part where I check the roots and make sure it is correct. |
| Sep 17 | 8:45-9:15pm |                                                                                                I am currently working on debugging my code. For some reason the cost is too high for every single one. I think it is because it is counting all possible edges instead of the ones needed so I need to fix that somehow |
